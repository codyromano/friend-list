## How it works

A simple web app that keeps track of your old friends — from childhood, previous jobs, college, etc. — with timestamps for when you last spoke with them.

The longer you go without clicking "Catch up" on a friend, the higher they'll appear in the list — a friendly reminder to get in touch.

## Getting started
```
npm install
npm start
```
## Adding friends

Use any SQLite client. I prefer [DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/).

## FAQ

- Why did you make this?
-- I made this so that I can be better about keeping in touch with people (especially those I don't see often). I'm planning to turn it into a touchscreen and put somewhere in the house.

- Doesn't [insert social media app name] already do this?
-- Not exactly. Facebook nudges you toward communicating with particular contacts for its own commercial gain. I don't blame them for this, but I want a simple, straightward sorting algorithm based on time.
